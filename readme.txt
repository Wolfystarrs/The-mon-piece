This is One Piece cobblemons. To change their textures, you add a flag either of the word "One Piece" or the name of the One Piece character. You can automatically convert all mons in your party using the command "/function cobblemon:onepiece".

Design credits:
Inspirations for the Strawhats, Mingo, Corazone and Buggy from @bumblesnail 
Inspirations for Ace and Sabo are from @heisoark 

Other designs are by me, aided by my brother
